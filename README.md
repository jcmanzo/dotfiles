# dotfiles

Collection of personal dotfiles, environment settings and tools that I like to use to keep my development environments in sync.

# Install

## Default

Clone repo and run `./install.sh` script. The `-f` flag can be passed to re-install everything.

## Using Curl

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcmanzo/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash
```

To re-install

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcmanzo/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash -s -- -f
```
